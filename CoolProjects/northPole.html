<h1 align="center"><u>How this Works</u></h1>
<h2 align="center">
This is the North Pole time clock, based on the idea that a single day in the North Pole (time from sunrise to sunrise) is a year elsewhere.<br />
The clock is quite simple actually, and was my first proper experience using JavaScript scripting in a web page.  Essentially, the clock takes the current day <br />
and calculates how much time has passed since December 21st (Winter Solstice), of the previous year.  Dividing this difference by 15, we can calculate what hour it is <br />
at the pole, in 24hour format.  Theoretically, at Summer Soltice in June - the clock should read 12:00 - and 00:00 at Winter Solstice. <br />
The inspiration for this project came from a New Scientist book, entitled "Why Don't Penguin's Feet Freeze" - specifically a question relating to the time in the North Pole.<br />
Albeit very late, hopefully this answers that question quite nicely.
